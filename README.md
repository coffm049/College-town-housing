# College-town-housing
A first exercise in Python comparing the effects of recession on the housing markets between college and non-college towns.

This exercise combined three different dataframes from Wikipedia, Zillow, and the federal government to compare housing markets during times of recession. The exercise was orinally assigned on a Coursera course I was auditing.
